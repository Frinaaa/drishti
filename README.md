                                 Drishti: Real-Time Missing Person Detection

This mini project, titled  Drishti, aims to create a real-time system that helps locate missing persons using a combination of  AI facial recognition and  IoT technology. The process begins when a user (such as a family member or authority) uploads a missing personâ€™ s image through a web or mobile interface. That image is processed by a facial recognition model, which generates a unique facial embedding used for comparison.
At the same time, a  Raspberry Pi with a camera module is used to continuously capture live video footage in a selected location. The AI system analyzes the video in real-time, detects faces, and compares them to the stored embeddings of missing individuals. If a match is found, the system sends an alert showing the time, location (based on the camera), and evidence image for verification.
All detections are logged for follow-up, and authorized users can track the results through a simple dashboard or app. Since this is a mini project, the system will demonstrate the core functionality using one or two cameras and a small dataset, focusing on how  AI and IoT can work together for public safety, even on a limited scale.
